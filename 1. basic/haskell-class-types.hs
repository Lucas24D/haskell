-- ---------- TYPE CLASSES ----------
-- Num, Eq, Ord and Show are type classes
-- Type classes correspond to sets of types which have certain operations
-- defined for them.
-- Polymorphic functions, which work with multiple parameter types, define
-- the types it works with through the use of type classes
-- For example (+) works with parameters of the type Num
-- :t (+) = Num a => a -> a -> a
-- This says that for any type a, as long as a is an instance of Num, + can take
-- 2 values and return an a of type Num

-- Create an Employee and add the ability to check if they are equal
